This directory contains any test cases and scripts created by the Oracle
Berkeley DB team for testing the Berkeley DB SQL interface.

The bulk of testing is handled by the SQLite Tcl test suite, which can be
found in:
lang/sql/sqlite/test

The subset of the test officially supported by Berkeley DB SQL can be run
using the bdb-test.sh script in this directory.
